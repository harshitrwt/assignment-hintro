# TaskFlow

A lightweight Kanban-style task manager built with **Next.js + TypeScript**. TaskFlow demonstrates drag‑and‑drop boards, local persistence, simple (mock) auth, filters/search, and animated UI components — ideal as a front-end assignment or starter kit.

---

## Quick overview

- Purpose: interactive task/kanban board with persistent state and activity log
- Stack: `Next.js (App Router)`, `React`, `TypeScript`, `Tailwind CSS`, `@dnd-kit` for DnD, `framer-motion` + `gsap` for animations
- Persistence: `localStorage` / `sessionStorage` via a small storage helper

---

## Key features

- Drag & drop tasks between columns (`To Do`, `Doing`, `Done`) using `@dnd-kit`
- Add / edit / delete tasks and track activity history
- Search, filter (by priority), and sort tasks
- Mock authentication (demo credentials) with optional "remember me"
- Responsive, animated UI built with Tailwind + shadcn/radix primitives

---

## Project structure (high level)

- `app/` — Next.js App Router pages (`/`, `/board`, `/login`)
- `components/` — UI components and feature pieces (`TaskBoard`, `TaskCard`, `TaskForm`, `Column`, etc.)
- `components/ui/` — small design-system primitives (buttons, inputs, cards)
- `context/` — `AppContext` (global reducer + provider)
- `hooks/` — reusable hooks (`useAuth`, `useLocalStorage`)
- `lib/` — helpers and `storage` wrapper around `localStorage`/`sessionStorage`
- `public/` — static assets (images, icons, screenshots)
- `types.ts` — TypeScript types and shared interfaces

Key files to inspect:
- `context/AppContext.tsx` — application state reducer + persistence sync
- `components/TaskBoard.tsx` — drag & drop integration and task sorting/filtering
- `hooks/useAuth.ts` — simple login/logout helpers (demo creds)
- `lib/storage.ts` — local/session storage abstraction

---

## Technologies & tools used

- Next.js (App Router) & React (TypeScript)
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- @dnd-kit (drag & drop)
- framer-motion & gsap for UI animations
- lucide-react icons, radix UI primitives, shadcn UI helpers
- ESLint + TypeScript for dev tooling

---

## How it works

1. Global state is managed in `AppContext` using `useReducer` (actions: add/edit/move/delete task).
2. Drag-and-drop is implemented with `@dnd-kit` in `TaskBoard` and `Column` components — on drop we dispatch `MOVE_TASK`.
3. Persistence: app state is saved to `localStorage` by `AppContext` (or `sessionStorage` when "remember me" is disabled).
4. Auth is mocked in `useAuth`.
5. UI: composed from small reusable primitives in `components/ui`, styled with Tailwind and animated via `framer-motion`/`gsap`.

## Detailed folder map

- `app/` — route pages (root `page.tsx`, `board/page.tsx`, `login/page.tsx`)
- `components/TaskBoard.tsx` — board layout + DnD context
- `components/Column.tsx` — column wrapper (drop zone)
- `components/TaskCard.tsx` — single task card UI & actions
- `components/TaskForm.tsx` — add / edit task modal/form
- `context/AppContext.tsx` — reducer, action types, persistence sync
- `hooks/useLocalStorage.ts` — react-friendly localStorage hook
- `lib/storage.ts` — safe storage wrapper for local/session storage
- `types.ts` — shared types for `Task`, `ActivityEvent`, `AuthSession`, etc.
